Kivy for OS X
=============

This repository contains the scripts for:

- creating a Kivy.app directory from scratch
- packaging a Kivy application using the previously generated Kivy.app
- creating a package (.dmg) of an application (.app)

This approach works starting from Kivy 1.9, with SDL2 and GStreamer in mind.
Anything else is untested.

Buildozer uses this repository for its OS X packaging process.
