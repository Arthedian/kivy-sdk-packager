Kivy for OSX
============

This repository contains the scripts for:

- create a Kivy.app directory from scratch
- package a Kivy application using the previously generated Kivy.app
- create a package (.dmg) of an application (.app)

The whole approach works starting from 1.9, with SDL2 and GStreamer in mind.
Anything else is untested.

Buildozer use this repository for its osx packaging process.
