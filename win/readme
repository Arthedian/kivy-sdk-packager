For example `--dir G:\Python\env\test --pythons py2.7.9_x86,py2.7.9_x64,py3.4.3_x86,py3.4.3_x64` will
create all 4 distributions.

Requirements, 7zip (see --7zip) and for a 64 bit installation git.

Notes:
    Gstreamer not included yet. mingw is huge and needs to be stripped.

Generates portable package for usage with kivy. It includes python and MinGW
for 64 and 32 bit platforms. To use, you specify the python versions to build,
paths to MinGW

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --dir DIR            path of dist directory to use for building the portable
                       python, the end result will be output to this
                       directory. Defaults to cwd (G:\Python\libs\kivy-sdk-
                       packager\win).
  --pythons PYTHONS    Comma separated list of the pythons to generate, in the
                       format of `pyversion_arch,pyversion_arch ...`, where
                       version is e.g. 2.7.6 and arch is either x86 or x64.
                       For example: py2.7.8_x86. Download links will
                       automatically be generated from
                       https://www.python.org/ftp/python/.One can also
                       directly specify the binary link using `pyversion_arch:
                       link:MD5,pyversion_arch:link,pyversion_arch...`, where
                       link can be remote or local (MD5 is optional). . If the
                       local link is a python exe, it will be installed to
                       that previously installed python, otherwise it must be
                       a .msi file. if not specified, the current python
                       process exe will be used
                       (py2.7.8_x64:E:\Python27\python.exe).
  --mingw MINGW        Path to MinGW. It is either a local path to a mingw
